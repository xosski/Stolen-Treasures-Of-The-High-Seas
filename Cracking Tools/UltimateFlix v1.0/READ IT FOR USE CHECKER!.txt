			    HOW TO USE THE CHECKER! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to have downloaded Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6
- Download link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net46-web-installer


Also you need to have Microsoft Visual C++ Librarys downloaded.
- Download link: https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/


- If you don't have the file "core.usdk", settings of checker won't be loaded and won't work!

- If you get the error of "Invalid username", because you put username with less of 5 charachters, you need to remove
  the file "login.usdk" and open checker again and put a valid username. That's all
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		     HOW TO USE THE TELEGRAM HIT SENDER! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you need to have the file of Telegram.txt on the same directory as checker file.

Later we will create our Telegram bot for send all hits we get, to our channel.


- First write to @BotFather and /start it and create the bot. Once you created it, should give you that: https://prnt.sc/11r3ae7
- Once we have our bot created, we will create a channel and add our Telegram bot here. He should have admin permissions on channel, or won't work!
- Now we have our bot on our channel where will send hits, should be like this: https://prnt.sc/11r3fzk - https://prnt.sc/11r3gft. Now we will send random message to channel.
- Once we sent post message to our channel, we will forward this message to this bot @JsonDumpBot and we will get the chat id, remember to get the id of channel and not your account!. Example: https://prnt.sc/11r3jvm - https://prnt.sc/11r3lk3
- Now we will fill the file "Telegram.txt" with this values we got. Example how should be: https://prnt.sc/11r3px5

That's the message you should get if you did all good: https://prnt.sc/11r3zfg - https://prnt.sc/11r49bp
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please, join to my channels if you want more tools of this kind free, and leave/share i'll appreciate. ^^

Don't fuck saying it's RAT/Virus, just it's the file protected that got detected as virus
because can't see content. If you think it's RAT, use cleaned VPS/RDP/VM/Sandboxie or don't use it, it's easy.

If i want i can do it, but i don't like to burn my reputation doing that stuff. 

Thanks for understand :)

Have good day.
Att, Kirlyh
