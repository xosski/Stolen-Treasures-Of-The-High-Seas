<<<<<<<<<<<<<<INFO>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The "1" on the first line, indicates the minutes for the stats message to send. 
1 = 1 min, so the message would be sent every 1 minute.

if the loghits is true, you will get a message with the working account you just got (On your webhook)

IMPORTANT: PLEASE ADD A WEBHOOK, I HAVEN'T TRIED WITHOUT ONE SO I DON'T KNOW THE ERRORS. ITS EASY TO ADD A WEBHOOK TO A DISCORD U OWN.

Recommendation: I recommend creating a discord server, name it LOGS or Accounts if u want. Go to Server settings, integrationsm webhooks, create webhook, copy link, and paste it above.
