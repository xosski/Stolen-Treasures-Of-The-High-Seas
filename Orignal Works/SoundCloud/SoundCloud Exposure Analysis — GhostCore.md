SoundCloud Exposure Analysis — GhostCore Red Team Report

Title: Client-Side Hydration Risks and Data Leakage on SoundCloud
Date: June 2025
Author: GhostCore Red Team Unit
Confidentiality: Red Team Internal / Disclosable Upon Coordination

Executive Summary

SoundCloud's modern web application framework relies on hydration of a large client-side payload. This hydration bundle includes user metadata, geoIP data, and track-specific information that expose several classes of vulnerabilities.

The GhostCore Red Team has identified multiple critical exposure vectors that compromise user privacy, application integrity, and pose potential abuse risks across authentication, session spoofing, and application routing boundaries.

1. Data Leakage via Hydration State

Vulnerability:

SoundCloud’s hydration payload includes user emails, their associated SHA256 hashes, account status, and confirmed flags.

Risks:

Potential doxing, targeted phishing, or re-identification via hash reversal databases.

Breach of CCPA/GDPR principles regarding minimal necessary disclosure.

Example:

"primary_email": "example@gmail.com",
"primary_email_sha256": "F2865052...",
"primary_email_confirmed": true

2. GeoIP Overexposure

Vulnerability:

Exact location data (city, lat/long, postal code) is embedded in hydration response.

Risks:

Enables triangulation of physical presence

Increases risk for stalking, IRL harassment, and location-based profiling

Recommendation:

Use coarse region resolution

Apply fuzzing to lat/long at hydration layer

3. App Linking Abuse

Vulnerability:

<link rel="alternate" href="android-app://com.soundcloud.android/soundcloud/sounds:TRACK_ID">

Risks:

Unsigned app links allow rogue APKs to register as valid handlers

Allows possible session hijack or phishing app impersonation

Recommendation:

Enforce App Link Verification using assetlinks.json

Block external intent resolution for unverified handlers

4. DNS Prefetch Poisoning

Vulnerability:

<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://api-v2.soundcloud.com">

Risks:

Permits early domain resolution without validation

Combined with open Wi-Fi or captive portals, could result in spoofed endpoints

Recommendation:

Use rel=preconnect with TLS verification rather than blind DNS prefetch

Implement DNSSEC or HTTPS-only enforcement

5. Permalink Injection Weakness

Vulnerability:

User-generated fields (permalink, title, description) may be rendered unsanitized in downstream modules

Exploit Potential:

Stored XSS or injection via improperly escaped characters (e.g., <script>)

Behavior varies between hydration context and rendering layer

Recommendation:

Escape + sanitize all dynamic content prior to hydration injection

Run DOMPurify or CSP checks on output JSON in debug mode

6. Session Replay / Header Leakage (Auxiliary)

Although not observed directly, tokens like track_authorization and HLS links may be exploitable via:

Shared link manipulation

Absent expiration headers

Lack of origin pinning

Conclusion

SoundCloud’s hydration architecture prioritizes speed and responsiveness but unintentionally leaks highly sensitive user data and creates attack surfaces that can be exploited by malicious actors. A shift toward server-side rendering for identity-related elements, tighter origin policies, and hardened geo/identity redaction is recommended.

This report can serve as a foundation for responsible disclosure, compliance alignment, or security remediation if conducted in cooperation with platform administrators.
