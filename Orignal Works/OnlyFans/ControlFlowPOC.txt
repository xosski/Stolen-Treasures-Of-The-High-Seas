Proof of Concept Impact Report — OnlyFans Media Access Control Flaw
Vulnerability Title
Broken Access Control on Media Assets Leading to Potential Unauthorized Access to Locked Content

Summary
During testing of locked purchase content on the OnlyFans platform, it was observed that the associated media assets (thumbnails and potentially full-size uploads) are hosted on a public file delivery endpoint with predictable, structured URLs.

The content delivery system appears to rely on UI-level gating to hide locked content rather than enforcing robust, server-side access controls for each request.
This means that, under certain conditions, asset URLs could be directly accessed or enumerated without the corresponding subscription or purchase, potentially exposing private media to unauthorized viewers.

Observed Behavior
Locked purchase posts include HTML referencing media file URLs in a static CDN path (e.g., /public/files/thumbs/.../avatar.jpg).

These URLs are accessible without a signed token, time-limited link, or session binding, suggesting public availability.

The URL path structure contains identifiable directory segments that could be predictable or sequential.

The platform UI correctly blocks the view of locked content, but the media server itself does not appear to verify user entitlements before serving the file.

Impact
Severity: Critical — This is a Broken Access Control issue (CWE-284) and may also qualify as an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) (CWE-639).

Potential consequences include:

Bypassing Payment Controls

Locked, paid content could be retrieved without subscription or purchase, resulting in direct revenue loss.

Exposure of Sensitive Content

Media may include private photos, videos, or other files that the content creator did not intend to share publicly.

Mass Enumeration Risk

Predictable directory and file naming structures could allow automated harvesting of large volumes of private content.

Data Protection and Legal Risks

Exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) or intimate media could trigger data protection law violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and reputational harm.

Attack Surface
Entry Point: Locked purchase content pages.

Vector: Direct access to underlying media asset URLs without session or entitlement verification.

Scope: All locked content stored in the affected CDN namespace.

Propagation: URLs may be shared publicly or indexed if leaked.

Recommended Remediation
Enforce Server-Side Access Checks

The media server/CDN should validate that the requesting user has an active entitlement to the requested asset before serving it.

Use Signed, Time-Bound URLs

Media URLs should include cryptographically signed tokens tied to the requesting user and expire after a short period.

Randomize and Obfuscate File Paths

Use non-predictable identifiers for stored media assets to prevent enumeration.

Invalidate Direct Access Without Referrer Validation

Only serve media when requests originate from authenticated, approved clients with valid tokens.
