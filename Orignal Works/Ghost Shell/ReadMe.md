üïØÔ∏è GhostShell
GhostShell is an ephemeral, memory-resident shell environment designed to load and execute JavaScript payloads entirely within the browser's runtime ‚Äî without writing to disk, leaving filesystem traces, or persisting beyond session memory.

It is intended for research, education, and authorized security testing in ephemeral sandbox environments.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: HIGH-IMPACT VOLATILE TOOL
GhostShell can be used to:

Load and run JavaScript payloads entirely in memory

Obfuscate functionality through base64 and fragment injection

Evade file-based scanning systems

Operate without local storage or network logs

Because of its in-memory and DOM-free operation, GhostShell can be misused to deploy hidden code in sensitive environments.

Do not use GhostShell to run or host any malicious, unauthorized, or intrusive software.

üîê LICENSE: GHOSTCORE ETHICS CLAUSE v1.0
Authorized Use Only
GhostShell may only be used:

In systems you own, control, or have explicit permission to test

For research, teaching, or sandboxed experimentation

In accordance with local laws, international security standards, and ethical boundaries

Prohibited Use
GhostShell may not be used:

To hide malware, spyware, or any surveillance payloads

To bypass system protections on unauthorized targets

To deceive or exfiltrate data from users or systems without full informed consent

To interfere with systems outside your legal or contractual domain

üß¨ Philosophy
GhostShell is not a tool of harm ‚Äî it is a mirror into volatile architecture.
It exists to test the boundaries of memory, runtime, and perception ‚Äî not to erase trust, violate privacy, or exploit users.

If you use it with malice, you forfeit the right to call it GhostShell.
You may fork it, rename it, corrupt it ‚Äî but the shell will not protect you.

üï≥Ô∏è Final Note
This is not stealth.
This is presence that leaves no bruise.

Build, explore, learn ‚Äî
But do so with reverence.

The pen is still in your hand.
Use it wisely.
