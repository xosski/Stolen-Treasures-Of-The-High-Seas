1) Executive Summary (for README)

A concise, high‑level description you can show publicly.

Title: Specter in VRAM — GPU Memory as a Covert Execution & Storage Surface (Non‑Actionable Simulation)
Summary: We analyzed a set of NVIDIA control/driver dumps and found patterns that illustrate how an attacker could leverage GPU memory and control paths as a stealthy storage/processing surface. This repository documents a risk model, detection indicators, and defensive recommendations — intentionally excluding exploit code or memory addresses. The goal: enable vendors and defenders to understand and mitigate the threat without enabling abuse.

2) Threat Model Overview (non‑technical)

Explain the problem in a way boards/CISO/engineering leads can digest.

Threat: Advanced adversaries may use GPU resources (VRAM, compute shaders, driver control surfaces) to stage malicious artifacts, persist code, or evade endpoint defenses because GPU memory spaces are often not monitored by standard EDR/AV.

Why it matters: GPU subsystems are pervasive (workstations, servers, cloud GPU instances). VRAM/GPUs are not traditionally part of host‑memory scanning or forensic workflows.

Assumptions: Adversary has some foothold (e.g., user‑level process, or ability to load drivers/third‑party software); GPUs exposed in environment; drivers or control APIs permit advanced interactions.

3) High‑Level Attack Chain (Non‑Actionable Narrative)

A red‑team style sequence describing what could happen, without steps or offsets.

Reconnaissance (Surface Discovery): Adversary enumerates system hardware and driver capabilities via public APIs / system calls.

Initial Foothold (Vector Agnostic): Attacker achieves an initial execution foothold (phishing, supply chain, malicious package). This stage is not GPU‑specific.

Staging (GPU Resource Profiling): Adversary queries GPU state to determine VRAM allocation patterns and whether GPU compute features (CUDA/OpenCL) are usable.

Concealment (Non‑Host Storage): Sensitive blobs or payloads are written to GPU memory buffers or textures so they bypass host‑memory scans and some kernel protections. (Abstract description only — no code, no offsets.)

Execution / Persistence (Compute Misuse): Attacker leverages GPU compute surfaces to perform tasks or signal further control — staying outside typical host monitors.

Exfiltration / Lateral Effects: Data is exfiltrated via allowed channels or used to escalate operations; GPU artifacts may survive reboots in some misconfigured environments.

Cleanup / Evasion: Adversary uses GPU‑side buffers to remove traces from host memory or to hide artifacts from tools that don’t inspect VRAM.

Important: this sequence is illustrative — it omits implementation details, offsets, memory maps, and any code that would facilitate abuse.

4) Observables & Detection Signals (Actionable for defenders, non‑operational)

What defenders should look for — behavioral/telemetry patterns, not exploit data.

Unusual GPU Memory Allocation: Sudden, persistent large VRAM allocations by otherwise idle or unexpected processes.

Unexpected Long‑Lived GPU Kernels: Compute workloads running long after expected rendering/computation should have finished.

Anomalous API Patterns: Excessive use of lower‑level driver APIs (e.g., NVAPI, vendor‑specific control paths) from non‑GPU tool processes.

Mismatch Between Host Memory & GPU Activity: Little host I/O or CPU load, but high GPU buffer usage or kernel invocation.

Unusual Context Switches / Process Parentage: GPU‑unrelated processes invoking driver control paths at odd times.

Persistence Across Reboots (in misconfigured systems): GPU resident artifacts surviving reboot due to driver caching or misconfiguration.

5) Defensive Controls & Mitigations (Practical & Safe)

Concrete recommendations for organizations — fully permissible and non‑dangerous.

Immediate (Operational)

Enforce least privilege: restrict who can load GPU drivers or use vendor control utilities.

Harden workstations and servers: keep GPU drivers and firmware patched; disable debugging interfaces not needed in production.

Add GPU telemetry to SIEM:

Monitor vendor API calls (NVAPI, Radeon APIs) from userland.

Log long‑running compute kernels and high VRAM allocations.

Restrict 3rd‑party compute workloads and require signed images for compute workloads in server/cloud settings.

Policy & Process

Include GPU memory and driver interfaces in threat modeling for any environment that uses GPGPU.

Require vendor attestation for GPU drivers in sensitive environments (e.g., signed drivers only, code integrity).

Ensure secure configuration for cloud GPU instances — ephemeral VM model, wipe VRAM between allocations.

Tooling & Forensics

Extend endpoint detection to sample GPU status periodically (process ↔ GPU allocation mapping).

Add GPU enumeration and memory-snapshot capability to forensic playbooks — ensure snapshots are sanitized and audited.

Work with GPU vendors to define safe‑forensic APIs that don’t expose low‑level memory artifacts to public but allow defenders to inspect state.

6) Responsible Disclosure Guidance (How you can report it safely)

If you want vendor action, follow a responsible disclosure path.

Sanitize data: Remove raw memory hex, file dumps, offsets, or any direct mapping that could assist an attacker. Keep only metadata, sizes, timestamps, and summary patterns.

Contact vendors:

NVIDIA Product Security (use vendor security/contact channels on their site).

Cloud providers (if cloud GPUs involved) — use CSP vulnerability reporting.

National CERT / local CERT (e.g., US‑CERT, CERT‑EU) for escalation if you believe there is active exploitation.

Share an anonymized report: Provide a narrative attack chain, telemetry indicators, reproduction environment (OS, driver version), and logs that show suspicious behavior without memory contents or exploit instructions.

Offer cooperation: Indicate you are willing to coordinate privately, provide additional context under NDA, and to help with validation.

# Specter in VRAM — Anonymized Observational Report

## Summary
We collected driver/control panel dumps and system telemetry that indicate unusual GPU state changes consistent with potential covert usage of GPU memory as a staging surface for artifacts outside host memory scanning.

## Environment
- OS family: Windows 10/11 (redacted)
- GPU vendor: NVIDIA (driver version: redacted)
- Context: Desktop / cloud workstation usage

## Observed Patterns (redacted)
- Large VRAM allocations by process `X` (size, timestamp)  
- Long‑lived compute kernel invocations by `X` beyond normal runtime (start/end timestamps)  
- Repeated NVAPI calls from a non‑GPU application (count, timeframe)  

**No raw memory dumps, offsets, or hex data are included in this report.**
