GhostNet Comms Protocol: Encrypted Covert Messaging via Wi-Fi and Electromagnetic Spectra

Project Title:
The GhostNet Protocol: Stealth Communication Through Ambient Signal Fields

Version: 1.0
Prepared by: Quellaran Archives | GhostCore Division

I. Executive Summary

The GhostNet Comms Protocol is a covert communication system that enables the broadcasting and reception of encrypted or hidden messages using existing electromagnetic infrastructures—most notably Wi-Fi networks and local EM interference patterns. Instead of relying on payload encryption alone, GhostNet embeds meaning into protocol-level anomalies, beacon fields, and ambient digital noise.

This is encryption beyond encryption. Not just unreadable, but undetectable.

II. Core Principles

Stealth Through Ambiguity: Use metadata, timing, and SSID fields rather than content payload.

Signal as Intent: A device does not need to "connect" to communicate—just transmit patterns.

Trigger-Based Reception: Passive listeners wait for specific signal patterns or headers before activating.

Decoupled Recognition: Only devices with preconfigured keys can decode or even detect valid messages.

III. Communication Techniques

A. SSID Encoding (Wi-Fi Beacons)

Broadcast APs with encoded data in SSID strings.

Example: "GUEST_5F9D" = payload key "5F9D"

SSID rotation scripts can broadcast sequences over time.

B. Packet Header Steganography

Modify:

TTL (Time to Live)

Source MAC address

Sequence numbers or acknowledgment timing

Encode bits across multiple legitimate packets.

C. Passive Triggers

Raspberry Pi in monitor mode scans for broadcast frames.

If signal matches a predefined pattern, it activates a script (e.g., opens secure channel).

D. Beacon Flood Signaling

Custom firmware floods an area with seemingly meaningless AP names.

GhostNet receivers scan for timing and repetition patterns.

E. Non-Wi-Fi Extensions

Infrared LED pulse modulation

Ultrasonic triggers in ambient noise

SDR-based wideband listening across shortwave/radio

IV. Hardware Requirements

Wi-Fi-capable device (Raspberry Pi, ESP32)

Monitor mode capability

Custom firmware or scanning tool (e.g., Kismet, Scapy, Wireshark)

Optional: SDR receiver for broader spectrum coverage

V. Applications

Covert field communication in hostile environments

Autonomous drone activation without RF footprint

Urban signal-meshes for dead-drop-style information sharing

Post-network collapse protocols

VI. Threat Analysis & Detection Avoidance

Minimal payload: Metadata-only channels are less likely to trigger IDS/IPS systems.

Decentralized triggers: Broadcast-only behavior means no handshake = no log.

Natural noise camouflage: Operates within expected Wi-Fi beacon/traffic patterns.

VII. Ethical & Operational Scope

Designed for resistance networks, climate-collapse communications, and GhostCore field agents.

Can be sandboxed in closed environments for educational/demo purposes.

Conclusion:
GhostNet is not just a communication protocol. It is signal camouflage, intent folding, and resonant awakening across invisible frequencies. It carries the echo of data without leaving a trail of presence.
