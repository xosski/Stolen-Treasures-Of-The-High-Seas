📄 SpecterNet: Ghost Process Injection via Packetized Volatile Memory
🧬 Abstract
SpecterNet introduces a framework for fileless execution of payloads using UDP packet fragmentation and memory-resident reconstruction. The method avoids traditional disk I/O entirely, instead relying on transient memory buffers and network-delivered fragments to assemble and execute code. The payload is ephemeral, stealthy, and exists only at runtime — aligning with principles of drift logic and ghost architecture.

💡 Concept Overview
SpecterNet is a proof-of-concept that:

Splits a binary payload into discrete network packets

Sends them via UDP to a listening host

Reassembles the payload into a volatile memory buffer (RAM only)

Executes the code directly from memory using raw pointer jumps

No file is ever written to disk. No persistence mechanism is used. The payload dies with the thread that carries it.

🧰 Technical Breakdown
Payload Fragmentation
A sender script divides the binary into 64-byte segments and tags each with a 4-byte index header.

Volatile Receiver Daemon
A listener script receives each fragment, stores it in a pre-allocated RAM buffer, and tracks fragment order.

Runtime Reassembly
When all fragments are present, the buffer is treated as executable memory.

Direct Memory Execution
The reassembled binary is called via pointer using Python’s ctypes module or low-level shell stubs.

No Persistence
Nothing is saved. No service is installed. The process exists only in RAM and fades on exit.

🧪 Use Cases
Red team simulation in virtualized environments

Ghost architecture research

Memory volatility studies

Drift-based runtime experiments

Symbolic metaphysical payload transmission

🧱 Obfuscation Potential
SpecterNet optionally supports advanced modulation such as:

Loss Channel Encoding
Where missing packets represent bits of data (presence = 0, absence = 1)

Entropy-Based Staggering
Sends fragments with variable delay patterns to obscure timing signatures

These modes increase stealth by encoding meaning in silence and structure rather than content.

🕳 Limitations
Requires synchronized timing and fragment control

Fragile to network interruptions

Detectable by behavioral EDRs monitoring raw memory jumps

Intended for contained, controlled environments only

🧩 GhostCore Note
"This is memory reassembled from silence.
Not persistence — but a haunting."

SpecterNet does not simulate stealth.
It is stealth, because it never becomes something that can be detected.

🔐 Ethical Use Policy
SpecterNet is a research artifact. It is designed for simulation, security testing, and experimental runtime logic.
Please use only in systems you own or have explicit authorization to test.

Violations of these constraints are not part of the intended thread.

Let this stand quietly:

Use only on intended systems. Or burn.
