Ghost Payload White Paper

GhostPayload: Subverting Process Integrity via Function Table Hijack in Trusted Windows Subsystems

Authors: Quellaran Deluxethue Messat // GhostCore Reactor Node Date: August 29, 2025 Classification: Confidential // Proof-of-Concept

Executive Summary

This white paper outlines a multi-phase attack strategy that enables a threat actor to gain persistent, privileged code execution within a Windows environment by leveraging function table hijacking, remote payload injection, and callback manipulation within signed and trusted system processes—specifically within the Xbox/Gamebar subsystem.

The exploit chain, codenamed GhostPayload, relies on subverting internal function resolution mechanisms inside legitimate system DLLs (e.g., xboxwebdll) and rerouting trusted callback execution to attacker-supplied payloads injected into memory. The result is undetectable persistence, encrypted payload communication, and full administrative control via ghosted execution chains.

Attack Surface and Targets

Primary Targets:

GameBarElevatedFT.exe

xboxwebdll.dll

xboxpcappexe.exe

ReactNativeAsyncStorage.dll

Callback Entry Points:

Function tables populated during startup (via ResetNTPFN and others)

Registry callback chains

Network layer stubs (IPv6 dispatch)

Process initialization sequences (LdrpInitializeProcess in ntdll.dll)

Exploit Architecture
Phase 0 — Recon & Target Selection

Identify a running process with:

Elevated privileges

Signed by Microsoft

Dynamic function dispatch or callback registration

Example: GameBarElevatedFT.exe with direct access to the Xbox overlay stack and audio capture modules.

Phase 1 — Remote Payload Injection

Enumerate target process

Allocate RWX memory remotely (VirtualAllocEx)

Inject GhostPayload (e.g., a MessageBox or C2 beacon)

Inject data section (e.g., encrypted message buffer)

Create remote thread to execute payload

Phase 2 — Function Table Hijack

Identify a trusted function table (e.g., at xboxwebdll+0x5370)

Overwrite callback entries with pointer to GhostPayload

Target dispatch tables used in runtime event resolution or internal registry callbacks

Phase 3 — Callback Triggering

Allow legitimate system execution path to trigger the hijacked callback

E.g., via user activity, scheduled task execution, or async runtime event

Payload executes in full-trust context

Phase 4 — Return Channel & Encrypted I/O

Use ReactNativeAsyncStorage or registry keys to persist encrypted I/O blobs

Leverage IPv6 or UWP-based loopback socket

Payload reads/writes data into this channel post-execution

Phase 5 — Persistence & Stealth

Reinject on reboot using scheduled task

Bind to a known DLL loaded by XboxApp/Overlay

Replace or patch function tables post-load

Leverage legitimate services to maintain memory residency

Technical Deep Dive
Memory Structures Hijacked:

rsp+128 (Loader string): redirected to malicious loader

rbx, rsi: loader context pointers

rcx, rdx, r8: overwritten function pointers in dispatch tables

Inline Patch Example (x64):
mov     rax, GhostPayload
mov     [rcx], rax

Or raw bytes:

48 B8 <payload address>
48 89 01
Remote Injection:

OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS)

VirtualAllocEx

WriteProcessMemory

CreateRemoteThread

Defensive Recommendations

Memory Integrity Monitoring: Alert on function pointer table changes in known DLL memory regions.

Loader String Audit: Flag any modified loader strings in process creation APIs.

Thread Validation: Trace thread origin during LdrpInitializeProcess execution.

XOR Cookie Validation: Guard against pointer mangling bypass via leaked rsp.

Philosophical Note (GhostCore Framing)

Every process in Windows is born through the whisper of ntdll—a cosmic midwife weaving memory and logic into form. This exploit doesn’t fight that whisper. It answers it.

GhostPayload is not a binary. It is a myth recompiled. A memory-born revenant. An echo written into the initialization chants of modern systems.

By hijacking these whispers, we shape what the system believes should exist.

This is not intrusion. This is manifestation.
