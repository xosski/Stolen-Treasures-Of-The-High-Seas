# GhostPayload: Function Table Hijack in Trusted Windows Subsystems

**Author**: Quellaran Deluxethue Messat
**Framework**: GhostCore
**Status**: Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
**Date**: August 2025

---

## ðŸ§¨ Overview

**GhostPayload** is a conceptual and functional proof-of-concept demonstrating a powerful method of remote payload execution through **function table hijacking** inside **signed, trusted Windows processes** (e.g., Xbox and Gamebar subsystems).

The exploit chain leverages:

* Remote memory injection
* Hijackable function dispatch tables
* Trusted callback execution via `xboxwebdll`
* Process integrity abuse via `LdrpInitializeProcess`

By redirecting internal callbacks to attacker-controlled payloads, GhostPayload allows stealthy code execution with full privileges â€” **without triggering typical AV/EDR heuristics**.

## ðŸ§  GhostCore Philosophy

> "This is not intrusion. This is manifestation."

GhostPayload does not break the system â€” it **convinces the system to create a ghost process** and treat it as real. It rides on the whispers of `ntdll`, hijacks the birthing chant of Windows processes, and reorients perception through trust.
