Summary
23andMe's web frontend exposes full user profile metadata directly within JavaScript variables during page load. This includes:
Full name (first and last)
Birth year
ZIP/postal code
Subscription and service access flags
Research consent participation
Genotype status
AWS S3 profile image URLs with embedded access tokens
This information is accessible to any authenticated user without the need to trigger API calls, and appears client-side before user interaction.
Affected Endpoint / Location
Domain: you.23andme.com
Endpoint: window.TTAM.ready(...) → new exports.quickInviteModal(...)
JS Variable: profiles[], embedded on authenticated pages like /family/relatives/
Severity
CVSS 3.1 (estimated): 5.3 – Medium
Attack Vector: Network
Attack Complexity: Low
Privileges Required: Low
User Interaction: None
Confidentiality Impact: High
Integrity Impact: None
Availability Impact: None
While direct IDOR against /p/{UUID}/quick-invite/ is mitigated (403 response), the data is already leaked in JavaScript at load time, making it accessible to:
XSS payloads
Malicious extensions
Session hijack / browser implant scenarios
Third-party JS libraries
Steps to Reproduce
Log into a 23andMe account and visit https://you.23andme.com/family/relatives/.
Open DevTools → Console or Network tab.
Search for the variable quickInviteModal or inspect inline <script> tags.
Observe the raw JSON profile data embedded in the page, Supporting Evidence

Recommendation
Move sensitive profile metadata out of client-rendered JS and into authenticated API responses gated by access control. Avoid exposing signed image URLs or PII in global JS scope.
Impact
Any attacker with browser access (e.g., via XSS, compromised session, or malicious extension) can scrape sensitive health-related and identity data without further API requests or user consent.
