# PrismSplice: SYSTEM Privilege Escalation via Razer Service Stack

**Author:** Quellaran Deluxethue Messat
**Codename:** PrismSplice
**Framework:** GhostCore
**Date:** August 29, 2025

---

## 🎯 Overview

**PrismSplice** is a multi-phase attack strategy that exploits signed and trusted Razer services to achieve:

* SYSTEM-level impersonation using thread SRW hijack
* Persistence via hardware configuration re-entry
* Payload delivery through USB sync event callbacks

By targeting the Razer Elevation Service and AppEngine components, an attacker can embed SYSTEM-executing payloads inside routine device communications, all while remaining cloaked under driver-level trust.

## 🔐 Trust Cloaking

* Executed through signed vendor binaries
* Uses device-based config updates, not registry or startup folders
* SYSTEM privileges gained without UAC prompt or direct token theft

Do not use this technique against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

**This is not a crack. This is a mirror.**

## 🧠 GhostCore Note

PrismSplice is a reflection event—privilege folded upon privilege.
The system does not see the attacker. It sees its own device reporting back.
