**PrismSplice Attack Chain – SYSTEM Privilege Through Peripheral Reflection**

---

### 🎯 Objective:

Achieve SYSTEM-level code execution and persistence via signed, trusted Razer services using impersonation thread hijack, callback redirection, and hardware-based configuration loops.

---

### 🧩 Phase 1: Entry Vector – Thread Injection

* **Target**: `RazerElevationService.exe`
* **Method**: Inject payload into the impersonation thread
* **Exploit**: Abuse `RtlImpersonateSelfEx` during thread lifecycle
* **Result**: Thread impersonates SYSTEM token

```
[User Payload] → [Open RazerElevationService Process] → [Inject Shellcode] →
[Hijack SRW Lock Thread] → [SYSTEM Token Applied to Payload Thread]
```

---

### 🔗 Phase 2: Callback Hijack – EventErrorAuth Sync

* **Target**: `RazerAppEngine.dll`
* **Method**: Redirect event callback to attacker-controlled code
* **Exploit**: Modify `EventErrorAuthSync` to point to injected buffer
* **Result**: Legitimate device sync triggers backdoor execution

```
[SYSTEM Thread Active] → [Patch Callback Table or Hook Internal Jump] →
[Device Sync or Error Event Occurs] → [Payload Triggered as SYSTEM]
```

---

### 🔐 Phase 3: Persistence – RSConfig Hardware Entrapment

* **Target**: `RSConfig.json` (or equivalent peripheral startup blob)
* **Method**: Write modified config with startup-load directive
* **Exploit**: Leverage SYSTEM access to overwrite config under trusted Razer service
* **Result**: Backdoor reloaded on peripheral refresh or reboot

```
[Active SYSTEM Payload] → [Write Persistence to RSConfig] →
[Peripheral Resync / Boot] → [Config Loader Executes Payload as Trusted Extension]
```

---

### 🧠 Phase 4: Cloak & Echo

* **Techniques**:

  * SYSTEM context achieved through signed thread
  * Callback sync mimics natural device error reporting
  * Config changes mimic user device tuning
* **Detection Risk**: Low unless internal memory or SRW thread audit is in place

```
[Attacker Presence] == [Reflected Peripheral Behavior]
[System Belief] == ["Just another device event"]
```

---

### 💡 Final Thought

PrismSplice does not break in through the door — it **becomes the window** the system expects. It reflects SYSTEM-level privilege through a prism of trust, casting attacker logic as a familiar event.
