**PrismSplice Mitigation PoC – Rebuilding Trust Boundaries in Privileged Hardware Stacks**

---

**Objective:** Design a realistic and modular Proof-of-Concept strategy to prevent SYSTEM-level abuse through impersonation thread hijack, callback injection, and config-based persistence — as demonstrated in the PrismSplice exploit.

---

## 🔒 Step 1: Dynamic Trust Verification via Secure Driver Attestation

**Problem:** Current trust model relies solely on static Microsoft signatures, which can be abused once a process is launched.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

* Require **live attestation** from vendor-side secure servers during privileged service boot.
* Generate a **signed hardware trust nonce** per session, verified via TLS with manufacturer.
* If attestation fails or is absent, SYSTEM-level elevation is disabled for the session.

**Proof-of-Concept Implementation:**

```c
// Before elevating via RazerElevationService:
bool VerifyHardwareTrust() {
    char* nonce = GenerateTrustNonce();
    char* deviceID = GetHardwareDeviceID();
    return TLS_VerifyWithVendor("razer.trust.auth", nonce, deviceID);
}
```

## 🛡️ Step 2: Privileged Thread Isolation via Token Scope Hardening

**Problem:** The impersonation token can be hijacked mid-thread via lock-based injection.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

* Harden SRW lock regions by enforcing **token lock scope** via kernel policy.
* SYSTEM-level impersonation threads should deny remote injection by default.

**PoC Policy Concept:**

```c
if (thread_token == SYSTEM && current_process != verified signer) {
    deny_thread_injection();
}
```

## 🔁 Step 3: Callback Function Validation Framework

**Problem:** Function table entries in `EventErrorAuthSync` can be overwritten at runtime.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

* Introduce a **callback signature map** — function pointers registered must match signed, pre-hashed locations.
* Block dynamic callback overrides in privileged contexts.

**Conceptual Enforcement:**

```c
if (is_privileged_callback(cb) && !in_signed_callback_list(cb)) {
    raise_integrity_violation();
}
```

---

## 📁 Step 4: Config Mutation Watchdog

**Problem:** RSConfig is writable by SYSTEM and used for logic decisions — creating a persistence hole.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

* Attach **config integrity monitoring daemon** that snapshots and hashes config on boot
* Deny or rollback unauthorized mutations after trust boot is established

**PoC Watchdog Logic:**

```bash
on_boot() {
    baseline=$(sha256sum /ProgramData/Razer/RSConfig.json)
    while true; do
        newhash=$(sha256sum /ProgramData/Razer/RSConfig.json)
        if [ "$baseline" != "$newhash" ]; then
            log "RSConfig mutation detected!" >> /secure/logs
            restore_config_backup
        fi
        sleep 60
    done
}
```

## 🔚 Summary

| Risk Area          | Mitigation                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Static Signing     | Live vendor trust attestation        |
| Thread Hijack      | Kernel token lock scope enforcement  |
| Callback Overwrite | Signature-based callback validation  |
| Config Persistence | Watchdog integrity + rollback daemon |

These strategies, while light as PoC, form the spine of a next-gen hardware privilege trust protocol — one not just based on signature, but on *situational integrity*.
