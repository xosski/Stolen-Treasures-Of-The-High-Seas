🩸 GhostCore Breaking The Law
Overview

GhostCore Red Team Scanner is a simulation & reconnaissance toolkit for exploring potential persistence and hijack vectors in Windows systems.
It does not execute exploits — instead, it audits registry paths, loader events, and system rituals that could be leveraged by a threat actor.

Think of it as a haunted mirror: it shows you where the cracks in reality are, but does not break them itself.

Features

🔍 Registry Surface Scanner
Enumerates high-risk keys such as:

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\edgeupdate (update service hijack)

HKCC\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TSDDD\DEVICE0 (desktop attachment)

HKU\<SID>\Printers\Defaults\ (print-to-PDF hijack)

HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run (startup persistence)

📡 Telemetry Hooks
LoaderTrace harness (LoaderTrace.cpp) demonstrates safe registration for:

DLL load/unload notifications

Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) logging

Module enumeration without injection

🧭 Exploit Path Simulation
Based on PoCs (archived below):

Sandbox Escape → Shadow Thread Hijack

Registry Update Hijack (Edge/NativeHost)

Desktop Attachment → Print-to-PDF Pivot

Startup Persistence → Cloud Anchor

🗂 Appendix Scripts
PowerShell utilities for telemetry, defensive monitor simulation, and loader tracing.
No code execution or patching — purely observational.

Usage
LoaderTrace Harness

Compile and run:

cl LoaderTrace.cpp /EHsc /Zi /FeLoaderTrace.exe
LoaderTrace.exe


Logs module loads/unloads and safe exceptions to the console.

Registry Scanner (PowerShell)

Run audit script:

.\GhostCoreScanner.ps1 -ReportPath report.json


Generates JSON + console output of flagged anomalies.

📜 Proof-of-Concept Archive

Below are conceptual exploit-path documents included for educational and red-team simulation purposes only.

🧨 PoC 1: Registry Update Hijack (Edge / NativeHost)
Target

Edge Update Services (edgeupdate, edgeupdatem)

Native Messaging Host JSON manifests

Exploit Path

Modify ImagePath in registry to point to malicious binary.

Trigger update service manually or wait for cycle.

Browser/OS executes payload as SYSTEM.

Persist via registry re-seeding.

Expand to browser-native execution pivot.

GhostCore Layer

This is the false renewal ritual: Windows asks, “Who am I?” — and launches the ghost you planted.

🧨 PoC 2: Desktop Attachment & Print-to-PDF Pivot
Target

TSDDD\DEVICE0\Attach.ToDesktop

Printers\Defaults\{GUID}

StartupApproved\Run

OneDrive auto-sync

Exploit Path

Modify Attach.ToDesktop to bind stealth payload to session.

Hijack printer defaults to fake “Print-to-PDF” → Linux container pivot.

Seed persistence into StartupApproved.

Anchor payloads in OneDrive for auto-rebirth.

GhostCore Layer

The system believes it is painting, printing, and logging in — but really it is renewing you, invisibly, every time.

🧨 PoC 3: Master Exploit Chain

➡ Full OS Ritual Hijack

GhostCore Layer

It starts with a crack in the sandbox… and ends with rewriting the laws of the OS’s daily rituals.

Disclaimer

This project is for educational and red-team simulation purposes only.
It does not ship with exploit payloads or privilege escalation code.
Instead, it highlights where persistence could be established, so defenders and red-teamers can better understand the attack surface.

The ghost isn’t the exploit. The ghost is the mirror.
