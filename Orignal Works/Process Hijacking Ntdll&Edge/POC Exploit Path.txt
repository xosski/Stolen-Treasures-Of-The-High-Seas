🧨 PoC Exploit Path Concept: Hijacking Process Init via ntdll → LdrpInitializeProcess
🎯 Target

The transition zone inside ntdll where:

LdrpInitializeProcess prepares the PEB/TEB,

DLLLoader stub (DLLLoader64_XXXX.exe) is invoked,

New thread stacks are created,

Pointers are cookie-mangled (xor rcx,rsp).

This is the pre-DLL load window = highest value.

⚡ Attack Surface

Heap/Stack corruption primitive

Input vector = browser/PDF/renderer bug, delivering a controlled memory overwrite.

Goal: corrupt rbx / [rsp+128] in the loader’s stack frame.

Key Structures to Hijack

rbx: base pointer into LdrpInitializeProcess.

rsi: points into minkernel\ldr\ldrinit.c.

[rsp+128]: wide string → "DLLLoader64_4429.exe".

These feed directly into process/thread creation.

🧭 Exploit Path
Phase 1 — Corruption Entry

Deliver malformed input (e.g. PDF stream, WASM heap object) that causes buffer overflow or UAF in renderer → memory corruption primitive.

Pivot overwrite into stack slot [rsp+128] or heap chunk referenced by rbx.

Phase 2 — Loader Redirection

Overwrite [rsp+128] (DLLLoader string) → "C:\Users\...\malicious_loader.exe".

When mov rdi,[rsp+128] runs, your binary becomes the child loader.

Since it’s still launched by ntdll, it inherits the parent process integrity.

Phase 3 — Fake Thread Info Injection

Corrupt rbx (points to LdrpInitializeProcess).

Instead of valid LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, feed pointer to crafted thread information block in attacker-controlled memory.

When call ntdll.7FFE39E42DE0 runs, it initializes a ghost thread with your stack.

Phase 4 — XOR Cookie Bypass

Recall: rcx = [rsp+C0] ^ rsp.

Attacker needs rsp leak (via side-channel or memory disclosure bug).

With known rsp, craft [rsp+C0] so that rcx → points into payload.

This defeats the pointer-mangling trick.

Phase 5 — Execution

At process commit, your fake thread or loader binary is accepted as legit.

Execution continues as if Windows created it.

Defender sees: signed ntdll → LdrpInitializeProcess → “child loader”.

In reality: your payload is now resident with full process privileges.

🛡 Hardening Notes

Defenders should:

Monitor integrity of loader strings (DLLLoader64_xxxx.exe) → suspicious replacements.

Watch for mismatched thread init structures during LdrpInitializeProcess.

Add guardrails to XOR-cookie validation leaks.

🧠 GhostCore Framing

This is literally the birth canal of a process.
Hijack the whisper here, and the system raises your ghost as if it were its own child.
That’s why Microsoft XORs with rsp — an anchor chant, trying to keep outsiders from being “born” into its stack.
But if you already know the stack’s resonance (leak), you can still walk in.

✅ That’s the exploit chain concept:
Memory corruption → overwrite loader args → redirect child process & fake thread → bypass XOR cookie with stack leak → payload executes as “legit” process init.
