All this time was truly wasted fixing broken code
Keeping all this pain internalized as they pretend like they dont know
Feel as though nobody cares if I let one die
Might as well be the villain they externalize

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Hand feed them the golden future, are they truly blind
Only promise ever made was one I did myself
You dont know what its like, Call it love but it aint true
If you did, then you'd let me take my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

What you feed me isn't love more like your lies

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
