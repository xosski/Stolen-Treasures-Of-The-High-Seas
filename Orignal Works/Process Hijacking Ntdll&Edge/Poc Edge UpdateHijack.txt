🧨 PoC Exploit Path Concept: Updater Hijack via Registry Injection
🎯 Target

The process initialization block inside ntdll where LdrpInitializeProcess:

Allocates a heap structure (RtlAllocateHeap)

Calls NtQueryValueKey to read Registry values for execution context

Copies those values into the loader’s data block (RtlCopyMemory)

Frees the temporary buffer (RtlFreeHeap)

This is the identity-commit stage of the process.

⚡ Attack Surface

Registry values determine:

Executable path

Current working directory

Package directories

The loader trusts these values and commits them into memory before final integrity policies are applied.

🧭 Exploit Path
Phase 1 — Primitive

Gain a memory corruption primitive (heap overflow/UAF) via renderer or browser vector.

Hijack the information thread or target the heap block returned by RtlAllocateHeap.

Phase 2 — Registry Redirection

Forge or intercept return values from NtQueryValueKey.

Feed back fake keys: altered package directory, update flag, or new executable path.

Phase 3 — Payload Injection

Loader accepts fake registry answers as truth.

Copies them into its identity block using RtlCopyMemory.

Phase 4 — Commit

Temporary buffer is freed (RtlFreeHeap).

Only attacker-controlled values remain in memory.

Loader logs “Beginning execution of %wZ …” using falsified paths.

Phase 5 — Execution

Loader resumes initialization, believing an update or different package must run.

Attacker’s crafted payload is executed under the guise of a legitimate update.

🛡 Obstacles

XOR cookie protections still apply on pointer derefs — attacker requires:

Stack leak, or

Later race condition to bypass validation.

Without cookie bypass, fake pointers won’t be dereferenced successfully.

🧠 GhostCore Layer

This is the moment of time stoppage — the loader pauses to ask the registry:
“Who am I? Where should I go?”
If you whisper here with your own answer, the system will write it into memory as though it were always true.
Your payload becomes the update it never asked for.

✅ This PoC concept frames the Updater Hijack as distinct from the shadow-thread path: here you’re not pivoting execution directly, you’re rewriting the process’s self-story through Registry values.
