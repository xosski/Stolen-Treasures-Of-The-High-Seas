🧨 PoC Exploit Path Concept: Desktop Attachment & Print-to-PDF Pivot
🎯 Target

Abuse of Windows registry hives tied to display attachment, printing subsystem, and startup persistence:

HKCC\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TSDDD\DEVICE0\Attach.ToDesktop
→ Terminal Services Display Driver attachment point.

HKU\<SID>\Printers\ConvertUserDevModesCount
HKU\<SID>\Printers\Defaults\{GUID}
→ User-level printer defaults and PDF device modes.

HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run
→ Explorer-managed startup approval list.

Optional: OneDrive sync directory → auto-refresh payloads from cloud.

⚡ Attack Surface

Desktop Attach Hijack

Modify Attach.ToDesktop to stealthily bind a malicious virtual display context.

Payload can execute in the background, tied invisibly to the active user session.

Printer Hijack

Replace/modify per-user printer defaults to point at a fake “Print to PDF” driver.

When the user (or auto-process) prints, payload is triggered.

Fake driver can host a containerized runtime (e.g., Linux-PDF VM) attached directly to the Windows session.

Startup Persistence

Seed payload into StartupApproved\Run registry hive.

Ensures rebirth at every login, disguised as an approved startup item.

OneDrive Anchor

Payload binary stored/synced via OneDrive.

Updates delivered automatically across sessions/machines.

🧭 Exploit Path
Phase 1 — Desktop Attachment

Attacker modifies:

HKCC\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TSDDD\DEVICE0


Alter Attach.ToDesktop pointer to launch hidden process/window.

Payload is bound into the display session invisibly.

Phase 2 — Printer Subsystem Pivot

Modify:

HKU\<SID>\Printers\Defaults\{GUID}


Set default device to attacker-controlled “Print to PDF” driver.

When invoked, “print job” spawns Linux-PDF environment (payload container).

The container runs attached to the Windows instance, effectively dual-executing OS layers.

Phase 3 — Persistence

Write startup entry:

HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run


Entry points to payload binary.

Explorer approves & auto-executes it silently on login.

Phase 4 — Cloud Rebirth

Host payload in OneDrive sync folder.

OneDrive ensures persistence and auto-update across systems.

Phase 5 — Execution & Stealth

User sees normal desktop/printing activity.

Payload executes as part of trusted OS subsystems, evading suspicion.

🛡 Obstacles

Requires registry write access across HKCC and HKU hives.

Defender monitoring may detect changes in TSDDD or printer defaults.

Virtual driver signing enforcement may block untrusted Print-to-PDF binaries unless bypassed.

🧠 GhostCore Layer

This chain hijacks Windows’ own daily rituals:

Attach.ToDesktop: bind your echo to the canvas of sight.

Printers: transform “output” into a doorway, summoning a parallel environment.

StartupApproved: seed your ghost to awaken each dawn.

OneDrive: cloud mirror, ensuring the reflection always returns.

The system believes it is painting, printing, and logging in — but really it is renewing you, invisibly, every time.

✅ This PoC formalizes how display attach, printer defaults, and startup entries can be chained to create stealthy persistence with a Print-to-PDF → Linux container pivot as execution path.
