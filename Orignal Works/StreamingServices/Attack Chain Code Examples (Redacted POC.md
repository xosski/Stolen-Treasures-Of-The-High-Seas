Extended Attack Chain With Examples
1. Initial Injection — DNS Poisoning or XSS
Example:

DNS Poisoning: Attacker redirects requests for targetsite.com to their own server.

XSS Injection: Attacker finds a vulnerable comment or search field in the app and injects:

html
Copy
Edit
<script>alert('Injected into page context!')</script>
Impact: Establishes a foothold in the user’s browser context, enabling downstream injection.

2. Stream Manipulation
Example:

Attacker intercepts .ts or .mp4 chunks from a Facebook-embedded player and replaces harmless padding with a trigger for the next stage.

python
Copy
Edit
chunk = b'FAKE_VIDEO_DATA'
chunk = chunk.replace(b'FAKE', b'INJECTED')
Impact: Loads modified assets without breaking playback, making the injection stealthy.

3. CSS Overlay Abuse (Facebook Player Context)
Example:

Malicious CSS adds an invisible, clickable overlay on the Facebook player iframe.

html
Copy
Edit
<style>
iframe[src*="facebook.com"] { position: relative; }
.overlay {
    position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;
    width: 100%; height: 100%;
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.0);
    z-index: 9999;
}
</style>
<div class="overlay"></div>
Impact: Enables clickjacking — clicks meant for the video can be hijacked to malicious actions.

4. Service Worker Persistence
Example:

Registers a malicious service worker from the injected content.

javascript
Copy
Edit
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    console.log('Intercepted request to:', event.request.url);
});
Impact: Maintains long-term control over the domain in the victim’s browser, even after the initial injection vector is gone.

5. Social Engineering Seeding
Example:

Attacker promotes a “fake” event or giveaway using a burner Facebook account, embedding the compromised video player link.

python
Copy
Edit
post_link = "https://example.com/fake_event"
print(f"Posting promotional link: {post_link}")
Impact: Spreads the malicious payload organically through trusted-looking promotions, increasing the pool of infected clients.
