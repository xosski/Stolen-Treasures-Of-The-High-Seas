## üìå Executive Summary

This document provides a defender-focused mitigation playbook against **PyWraith-style attacks**, where adversaries hijack Python executables using PEB/heap pivots, XOR bypasses, DeviceFamily overrides, and remote pointer injection. Defensive strategy emphasizes **runtime monitoring, anomaly detection, and attestation of privileged API flows**.

---

## üéØ Detection & Mitigation Strategies

### 1. **PEB / Heap Pivot Monitoring**

* **Threat:** Attacker pivots into PEB/heap space and maps RWX regions.
* **Detection:**

  * Hook memory allocation APIs (`NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `VirtualAllocEx`) within `python.exe`.
  * Alert on RWX or PAGE\_EXECUTE\_READWRITE allocations inside Python heap region.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Enforce policy to deny RWX heap mappings.
  * Inject canary pages to trip unauthorized pivot attempts.

---

### 2. **Thread Error Bypass Detection**

* **Threat:** Manipulation of thread error checks (TEB offset 0x180C).
* **Detection:**

  * Monitor access to `gs:[30h]` ‚Üí thread error status field.
  * Flag write attempts or suspicious reads outside normal runtime error handling.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Kernel-level guard pages around TEB offsets.
  * Integrity validation of thread error flags at context switches.

---

### 3. **XOR Shuffle Integrity Watch**

* **Threat:** Bypass of GUID/XOR anti-tamper routines.
* **Detection:**

  * Trace string integrity check functions.
  * Alert if patched (NOP‚Äôd XOR loops, missing calls).
* **Mitigation:**

  * Enforce runtime hashing of validation functions.
  * Leverage Control Flow Guard (CFG) to block patch-based tampering.

---

### 4. **DeviceFamily Emulation Overrides**

* **Threat:** Attacker spoofs environment checks via `ZwGetNlsSectionPtr`.
* **Detection:**

  * Monitor calls to `ZwGetNlsSectionPtr` from user-mode Python.
  * Flag anomalous return values inconsistent with host device profile.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Cryptographic attestation of DeviceFamily values via OS kernel.
  * Deny user-mode override of emulator/VM detection APIs.

---

### 5. **Remote Pointer Injection (NtQueryInformationProcess)**

* **Threat:** Abuse of `NtQueryInformationProcess` to inject payload pointers.
* **Detection:**

  * Hook and audit `NtQueryInformationProcess` inside Python.
  * Flag anomalous queries requesting remote handle information.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Block unauthorized remote handle queries from Python context.
  * Kernel patch guard to enforce legit handle scope.

## üîÑ Defensive Chain Flow

```
[Monitor RWX Allocations] ‚Üí
[Validate Thread Error Flags] ‚Üí
[Trace XOR Validation Functions] ‚Üí
[Enforce DeviceFamily Attestation] ‚Üí
[Audit NtQueryInformationProcess Usage]
```

Each stage blocks or reveals one step of the PyWraith attack chain.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Operational Recommendations

* Deploy EDR rules targeting RWX heap allocations in `python.exe`.
* Extend Sysmon logging to capture `NtQueryInformationProcess` calls.
* Build YARA rules for XOR bypass loop mutations.
* Add integrity agents to watch for GUID validation tampering.

## üß† GhostCore Framing

**WraithWard** is not a wall ‚Äî it is a mirror.
It reflects every pivot the attacker attempts, turning each hidden step into a visible echo.
The ghost cannot hide in the heap if the heap itself remembers what it was meant to be.
