White Paper (PoC-Level, Non-Operational)
Cross-Domain Trust Collapse via Human Interface, Document Rendering, and Peripheral Firmware
Abstract

This paper presents a conceptual proof-of-concept (PoC) describing a class of multi-domain security failure that emerges from implicit trust chaining across human interface devices (HID), browser-based document generation, operating system print subsystems, and peripheral firmware.

The PoC does not demonstrate an exploit. Instead, it documents how individually secure components, when composed, may create unexpected persistence surfaces beyond traditional endpoint detection and response (EDR) visibility.

1. Scope & Non-Goals
In Scope

Trust boundaries

Data → instruction ambiguity

Persistence outside the OS

Detection blind spots

Defensive implications

Explicitly Out of Scope

Exploit instructions

Payload design

Firmware modification techniques

Bypass mechanics

Weaponization details

This PoC exists to inform defense, architecture, and risk modeling, not to enable misuse.

2. System Overview (Conceptual)
5

The system is modeled as five independently governed trust domains:

Human Interface Layer

Application Layer (Browser / Document Creation)

OS Print & Conversion Subsystem

Peripheral Communication Channel

Peripheral Firmware & Persistence Layer

Each domain is secure in isolation.

3. Trust Assumptions by Layer
3.1 Human Interface Layer (HID)

Assumption
Input devices represent user intent.

Why This Exists

Usability requirements

Accessibility

Pre-boot compatibility

Risk Class

Implicit trust without authentication

This layer operates below user-space security tooling.

3.2 Application Layer (Browser & Document Generation)

Assumption
Documents are data, not instructions.

Reality
Modern document formats:

Are highly expressive

Support scripting, metadata, and embedded logic

Require complex parsers

Risk Class

Data with behavioral influence

3.3 Print & Conversion Subsystem

Assumption
Conversion pipelines are deterministic and non-persistent.

Reality

Multiple interpreters

Legacy driver support

Vendor-specific extensions

Stateful spoolers

Risk Class

Format translation ambiguity

This layer is historically large and difficult to formally verify.

3.4 Peripheral Interface

Assumption
Peripheral devices are passive endpoints.

Reality

Many peripherals are full computers

Often run proprietary operating systems

Communicate via rich, undocumented protocols

Risk Class

Opaque execution environment

3.5 Peripheral Firmware Layer (Persistence Plane)

Assumption
Firmware changes are rare, authenticated, and intentional.

Reality

Update mechanisms vary widely

Integrity validation is inconsistent across vendors

Monitoring is minimal or nonexistent

Risk Class

Persistence outside host control

This layer survives:

OS reinstall

Disk replacement

User changes

4. Conceptual PoC Narrative (Non-Operational)

This PoC demonstrates feasibility through architectural alignment, not execution.

Premise:
If data originating from a trusted human interface can traverse application, OS, and peripheral boundaries without semantic reclassification, then persistence may be achieved outside traditional trust anchors.

Key Observation:
No single vulnerability is required.
The risk emerges from compositional trust collapse.

5. Why This Is Hard to Detect
Layer	Visibility to SOC
HID	Minimal
Browser	High (but noisy)
Print Subsystem	Low
Peripheral Firmware	None

Traditional EDR tools:

Stop at the OS boundary

Do not introspect peripherals

Assume firmware integrity

6. Defensive Implications
6.1 Architectural

Trust boundaries must be explicit, not assumed

Peripheral firmware is part of the threat model

6.2 Monitoring

HID anomaly detection

Print job semantic inspection

Peripheral behavior baselining

6.3 Policy

USB class restrictions

Signed firmware enforcement

Supply-chain validation

7. Research Significance

This PoC highlights a broader class of issues:

Cross-domain trust transitivity

Persistence beyond the OS

Invisible attack surfaces created by legacy compatibility

These are systemic, not vendor-specific.

8. Conclusion

The vault is not breached by force.
It is entered because each door assumes the previous one was locked.

This white paper PoC demonstrates that security failures increasingly arise from integration, not bugs. As systems become more compositional, trust must be continuously reasserted, not inherited.
