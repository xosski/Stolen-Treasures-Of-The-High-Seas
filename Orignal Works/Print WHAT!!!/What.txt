1. Outer Perimeter: Human Interface Trust Zone

(The front door everyone forgets to lock)

Assets

User workstation

Physical I/O ports (USB)

Implicit Trust Assumption

Anything enumerating as a keyboard is benign and user-intentional.

Vault Wall

OS-level HID drivers

No authentication, no intent verification

Structural Reality

This layer is intentionally frictionless by design.

It exists below application-level security controls.

Architectural note: This is not a bug; it’s a usability tradeoff hardened into decades of OS design.

2. Application Boundary: Browser & Document Generation Layer

(The marble lobby—beautiful, busy, and complex)

Assets

Browser engine

Print-to-PDF or export pipelines

Document object models

Trust Transition

Human input → Application logic

Application data → Structured document formats

Vault Wall

Sandboxing (browser)

File-type assumptions (PDF as “data, not code”)

Structural Reality

Modern document formats are program-like in complexity.

Rendering ≠ interpretation ≠ conversion.

This is where data becomes behavior-adjacent—not executable, but influential.

3. Conversion Chamber: Print & Rendering Subsystem

(The pneumatic tubes behind the teller desk)

Assets

OS print spooler

Format converters (e.g., PDF → raster → device language)

Trust Transition

High-level document → low-level device instructions

Vault Wall

Driver isolation

Spooler service boundaries

Structural Reality

Print systems exist to support every device ever made.

Legacy compatibility is prioritized over minimalism.

This layer is historically large, stateful, and under-audited.

4. Peripheral Interface: Printer / Device Boundary

(The loading dock)

Assets

Printer firmware

Device-side interpreters

Update mechanisms

Trust Assumption

Jobs sent to the device are non-persistent and non-authoritative

Vault Wall

Vendor firmware checks

Update mode gating

Structural Reality

Many peripherals operate as semi-autonomous computers.

Firmware trust chains vary wildly by vendor and age.

This is outside the OS’s jurisdiction—a different kingdom with different laws.

5. Inner Vault: Firmware & Persistence Plane

(The actual vault)

Assets

Non-volatile memory

Boot routines

Device identity & behavior

Trust Model

Firmware is assumed static unless explicitly updated.

Updates are assumed intentional and authenticated.

Vault Wall

Cryptographic signing (sometimes)

Physical access assumptions (often)

Structural Reality

Persistence here survives:

OS reinstalls

Disk wipes

User changes

This is why firmware is attractive in theory—and why it’s so heavily defended in practice.

6. Cross-Cutting Observation: Where Vaults Crack (Conceptually)
Layer	Structural Tension
HID	Usability vs. authentication
Browser	Safety vs. document expressiveness
Printing	Compatibility vs. minimal attack surface
Firmware	Longevity vs. updatability

None of these are mistakes.
They are engineering compromises.

🧭 Mental Model Summary (The Blueprint)

No single layer is “the exploit”

The risk emerges only at the seams

Each boundary assumes the previous one was honest

Persistence lives where visibility dies

Or, put differently:

The vault is secure.
The hallways between vaults are where ghosts walk.
