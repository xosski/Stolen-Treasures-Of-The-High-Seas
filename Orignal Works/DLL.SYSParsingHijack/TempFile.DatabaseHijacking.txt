🧩 1. How a DLL interacts with database/text files

A DLL is just code, but it often depends on external state (configs, cache, SQLite/other DBs, plain text).

When it calls a function like sqlite3_open() or fopen(), it trusts the path/data it’s told to read.

That means: if you can control the contents of those files, you indirectly control the DLL’s behavior.

⚔️ 2. Hijacking a Database File
Hypothetical attack flow:

The DLL expects data.db in C:\ProgramData\App\.

The legitimate DB has expected tables, rows, values.

An attacker swaps it with a poisoned database:

Add malicious payloads (e.g., overly long strings → buffer overflows in parsing code).

Inject weird metadata (e.g., corrupted headers to cause exception handling flaws).

Abuse logic flaws (e.g., set flags in the DB that tell the DLL to skip checks or load unsigned modules).

This is very realistic — lots of software crashes or becomes exploitable when handed a malformed or hostile database file.

🔀 3. Temporary File / Text File Hijacking

DLLs (and the programs using them) often read from:

.ini, .json, .xml, or .log files.

Temporary files written to %TEMP% or /tmp.

If those files are writeable or swappable:

An attacker could change values that control DLL loading.

For instance, DLL reads config.ini → LoadModule=foo.dll. If you change it to evil.dll, you’ve just redirected execution.

Even without sideloading a new DLL, you could cause the existing one to misbehave by feeding it wrong paths, data types, or function inputs.

🚧 4. Why This Could Derail a DLL

Because DLLs are deterministic code that expect structured inputs.
If you can corrupt/redirect those inputs:

Memory corruption (classic exploit vector).

Logic subversion (telling the DLL to do something it normally wouldn’t).

Privilege abuse (e.g., DB says "user=admin", DLL trusts it).

This bypasses “DLL sideloading” because you don’t need to plant a malicious DLL — you just weaponize what the existing DLL already does.

🛡️ 5. What prevents this (in theory)

File permissions / ACLs: If the database/text files are write-protected (system-owned, not user-owned), hijacking is harder.

Cryptographic signatures/checksums: Some apps sign their DB/config files and verify them at runtime.

Sandboxing: A DLL that runs in a sandbox can’t just accept arbitrary file manipulation.

Validation code: Defensive programming checks for corrupted data before use (though many devs skip this).

⚖️ GhostCore Take

You’re pointing at a subtle truth:
Sometimes you don’t need to break the lock. You just hand the lock the wrong key and watch it open itself.

Hijacking a database or text file is like creating a paradoxical sideload:

The DLL isn’t replaced.

The system is untouched at the binary level.

Yet its behavior is derailed because its memory, logic, or trust assumptions were hijacked from inside its own data flow.

✨ TL;DR:
Yes — hijacking a database file (or temp text file) can derail a DLL just as effectively as sideloading.
It works because data = code once parsed. What prevents it in the real world is usually permissions + validation, but many apps don’t implement those properly.
