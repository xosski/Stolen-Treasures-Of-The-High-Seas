Abstract

This paper introduces a theoretical attack surface arising from a misinterpretation of Windows driver and library file parsing boundaries. By presenting a .sys driver file mislabeled as a .dll, or vice versa, it may be possible to confuse the loader and exploit an overlap in parsing logic. This creates a potential "crack in the veil" where payloads can be disguised within otherwise benign-looking file types (such as .jpg or .mp4) and lead to arbitrary code execution at kernel privilege levels.

Introduction

Traditional side-loading requires the placement of a malicious .dll in place of or alongside a legitimate one. However, this approach relies on the userland process being tricked into calling the fake .dll.

The PoC idea expands this surface: instead of direct side-loading, leverage parsing ambiguity between .sys (kernel drivers) and .dll (userland libraries). When the operating system attempts to interpret the file incorrectly, it may allow attacker-controlled instructions to bleed across privilege boundaries.

Threat Model

Input Vector: A malicious file masquerading as a .dll or .sys, potentially polyglot (valid header portions of multiple formats, e.g., JPG/PE).

Trigger Condition: A process, parser, or tool attempts to load the misnamed file.

Exploit Behavior:

PE parser fails gracefully but leaves a pathway for code to be mapped.

Kernel driver context accepts attacker-controlled sections.

Impact:

Thread hijacking.

Arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.

Potential persistence without conventional side-loading indicators.

Proof-of-Concept Description

A benign-looking file (e.g., holiday.jpg) contains hidden PE sections (Portable Executable).

The file is renamed driver.sys.

A process attempts to analyze or load it under DLL explorer or related parsing tools.

Instead of rejecting outright, the parsing logic partially succeeds.

Attacker code is mapped into a driver-level thread context.

Key Observation: The system may attempt to "open" the file even when mislabeled, confirming parsing ambiguity exists.

Threat Map (Conceptual)
 Userland (DLL space) ──▶ Loader Veil ──▶ Kernel (SYS space)
   [benign DLLs]           [parsing crack]   [legit drivers]
   [polyglot payload] ────────▲──────────────[exploit path]
                              │
                      Arbitrary code injection
                      Elevated kernel privileges

Potential Impacts

Kernel-level malware with little forensic trace.

Covert persistence mechanisms that hide as non-executable media.

Escalation of privilege bypassing traditional sideload defenses.

Threat to secure boot and driver trust chains.

Mitigations

Strict Parsing Enforcement – Ensure .sys and .dll file format checks are mutually exclusive.

Polyglot File Detection – Scan for multiple valid headers (e.g., PE + JPG).

Code Signing Enforcement – Refuse unsigned drivers regardless of file extension.

Sandboxed Parsing – Ensure exploratory tools do not load ambiguous binaries in privileged contexts.

Conclusion

This PoC demonstrates that trust boundaries between file formats (.dll vs .sys) represent a fragile veil. While this is not a working exploit, the concept highlights potentially dangerous parsing cracks. By addressing them proactively, defenders can strengthen trust in binary execution and reduce avenues for privilege escalation.
