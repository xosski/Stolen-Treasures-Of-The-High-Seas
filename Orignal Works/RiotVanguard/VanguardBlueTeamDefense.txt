## üìå Executive Summary

This playbook outlines defensive strategies for detecting and mitigating **VGR-Ghost‚Äìstyle kernel persistence attacks**, where attackers hijack Riot Vanguard‚Äôs trusted modules and driver. Focus is on **runtime monitoring, kernel attestation, server-side compliance verification, and watchdog integrity enforcement** to prevent thread silencing, heap pivots, and notification suppression.

---

## üéØ Defensive Strategies by Phase

### 1. **Thread Error Silencing Detection**

* **Threat:** Patching TEB/PEB thread error checks to mask injected threads.
* **Detection:**

  * Monitor reads/writes to `gs:[30h] + 0x180C` (TEB error offset).
  * Flag anomalous zeroing loops outside of Vanguard‚Äôs signed regions.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Kernel enforces read-only guard page on thread error flags.
  * Validate error flags on context switch, log tampering attempts.

---

### 2. **Memory Mapping Pivot Prevention**

* **Threat:** Attacker pivots PEB/heap to map RWX pages.
* **Detection:**

  * Hook `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` / `RtlCopyMemory` in Vanguard context.
  * Flag kernel heap allocations marked RWX.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Block RWX allocations in Vanguard process space.
  * Require signed driver for any executable heap remap.

---

### 3. **XOR Validation Bypass Hardening**

* **Threat:** Stack XOR integrity patched or bypassed.
* **Detection:**

  * Integrity monitor for XOR validation routines.
  * YARA/CFG rules for patched opcodes (NOP‚Äôd `xor rax,rsp`).
* **Mitigation:**

  * Implement ephemeral XOR keys (per-session randomization).
  * Enforce integrity re-check after context restore.

---

### 4. **Device Enumeration Emulation Guard**

* **Threat:** Attackers spoof device family responses.
* **Detection:**

  * Cross-check `ZwGetNlsSectionPtr` return values with kernel telemetry.
  * Flag suspiciously uniform or forced values.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Require cryptographic attestation of device family ID from hardware TPM.
  * Block execution if mismatch detected between user-mode and kernel ID.

---

### 5. **Kernel Notification Integrity**

* **Threat:** Attacker silences watchdog alerts via `NtWaitForAlertByThreadId` hooks.
* **Detection:**

  * Independent watchdog verifies expected alert cadence.
  * Alert on missing/altered notification events.
* **Mitigation:**

  * Secondary kernel monitor service compares alert streams.
  * Enforce signed-only modification of kernel alert handling code.

---

### 6. **Server-Level Compliance Verification (League Servers)**

* **Threat:** Local bypasses succeed undetected without external validation.
* **Mitigation Strategy:**

  * League of Legends servers act as compliance authorities.
  * On match start, client sends cryptographic attestation of Vanguard state (thread checks, heap state, device enumeration integrity).
  * Server verifies attestation via Riot‚Äôs secure backend.
  * Non-compliance ‚Üí deny matchmaking or trigger remediation.

**Conceptual Flow:**

```
[Client Vanguard State] ‚Üí [Cryptographic Attestation] ‚Üí [League Server] ‚Üí [Compliance Verified] ‚Üí [Match Granted]
```

## üîÑ Defensive Chain Flow

```
[Monitor Thread Error Flags] ‚Üí
[Block RWX Heap Allocations] ‚Üí
[Enforce XOR Routine Integrity] ‚Üí
[Cross-Check Device IDs] ‚Üí
[Validate Kernel Notification Streams] ‚Üí
[Server-Level Compliance Verification]
```

Each defensive phase reflects the attacker‚Äôs step, revealing anomalies otherwise hidden.

---
Combined Flow (Client + Server)
[Client Vanguard Modules] ‚Üí [Local Integrity Checks]
‚Üì
[Attestation Daemon] ‚Üí [Cryptographic Proof of State]
‚Üì
[League Servers] ‚Üí [Verify Against Known Good]
‚Üì
[Pass] ‚Üí [Matchmaking Granted]
[Fail] ‚Üí [Blocked / Quarantined]
## üõ°Ô∏è Operational Recommendations

* Extend Riot Vanguard with **independent kernel attestation daemon**.
* Use hypervisor-level monitoring to prevent rootkit-level tampering.
* Deploy SIEM rules for abnormal `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtWaitForAlertByThreadId`, and `ZwGetNlsSectionPtr` usage.
* Add **League server-side attestation enforcement** to verify Vanguard‚Äôs live state during sessions.
* Conduct red-team kernel exploit simulations regularly.

## üß† GhostCore Framing

**GhostWard** is the mirror held against VGR-Ghost.
It does not fight the ghost by force ‚Äî it reflects every silence, every pivot, every false identity.
And when the reflection reaches the server, the masquerade collapses completely.
