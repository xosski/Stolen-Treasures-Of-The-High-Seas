üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Treasures of the High Seas
‚ÄúThere are sites that live on servers. And then there are ghosts that live in memory.‚Äù

Treasures of the High Seas is a curated archive of experimental, phantom-layer web infrastructure ‚Äî a toolkit for memory-native applications, ghost-driven browsers, and code that exists only because you asked it to.

This project fuses Specter-Net, Wraithbinder, and Nullwake into a single multiversal stack ‚Äî where service workers become dreamcatchers, pages are summoned from raw memory, and site logic floats in and out of existence like wreckage from deeper timelines.

üß≠ Philosophy
This is a repository for:

- Pages that exist only in memory
- Content that vanishes when the tab closes
- Filesystems built from drift
- Applications that boot from thought, not file

‚ÄúThe sea remembers every ship that sank. Nullwake is how we sail them again.‚Äù

üõ† How to Use
Register the Phantom Service Worker:
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/Wraithbinder.js')
```

Inject a Memory-Based Site:
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
  reg.active.postMessage({
    type: 'inject_compiled',
    payload: { 
      "/": { type: "raw", content: "<!doctype html><html>..." },
      "/ghost.js": { type: "raw", content: "console.log('haunted')" }
    }
  });
});
```

Trigger PhantomLayer:
import './dist/PhantomLayer.bundle.js';
```

Use the Build Pipeline:
node build-pipeline.js
```

Refresh. The page now lives in Nullwake.

üîÆ Use Cases
- AI-generated ephemeral sites
- Dead drop memory shells
- Web IDEs with zero filesystem I/O
- Causal simulations
- GhostCore overlays and drift emulators
- Fingerprint-resistant browser defenses
üï≥Ô∏è GhostShell: How to Use
GhostShell is a memory-only execution engine that runs base64-encoded payloads inside your browser console, fully volatile, never touching disk. Useful for ephemeral apps, anonymous computations, or phantom-layer scripting.
Initialize GhostShell:
// Paste this in your browser's dev console
injectGhostShell(); // Or load from local GhostShell.js
Inject Base64:
injectGhostFragment(0, "YmFzZTY0ZW5jb2RlZHBhcnQx...");
injectGhostFragment(1, "YmFzZTY0ZW5jb2RlZHBhcnQy...");
// Continue until complete
Clear Immediately:
gs('purge'); // Wipes all traces
Custom Fragments:
Use any JavaScript payload. Encode with btoa() or any base64 tool, then split into 64-character segments.
Example:
const b64 = btoa('alert("Ghost online.")');
// Split b64 and inject with injectGhostFragment(i, segment)
