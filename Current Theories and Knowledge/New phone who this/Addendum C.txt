Appendix C: Cloud Backup & Trust Inheritance Risks in Account Recovery
Overview

Modern mobile ecosystems increasingly decouple messaging from physical SIM ownership, enabling message delivery via cloud accounts and Wi-Fi-connected devices. While this enhances usability and resilience, it introduces trust inheritance risks when combined with account recovery workflows.

Identity vs Device vs Account

A critical distinction exists between:

Layer	What it represents
Device	A physical object
Backup	A snapshot of state
Account	An identity authority

Recovery systems often collapse these layers, assuming that prior association implies continued legitimacy.

Risk Pattern: Trust Persistence After Recovery

When an account is recovered or reassigned:

Previously trusted devices or backups may still appear legitimate

Messaging and verification flows may rely on historical trust

Users may be unable to distinguish legitimate recovery from impersonation

This is not a cryptographic failure—it is a trust lifecycle failure.

Why This Matters for Login & Recovery Security

If:

Phone numbers can be reassigned

Cloud accounts can be recovered

Devices can restore trusted state

Then identity recovery becomes the weakest link, regardless of message encryption strength.

Defensive Recommendations (Platform-Agnostic)
1. Trust Reset on Recovery

Account recovery should:

Explicitly invalidate all prior device trust

Require re-approval for messaging and verification channels

2. Backup Restoration ≠ Identity Restoration

Restoring data should not:

Automatically restore authentication authority

Re-enable messaging trust without user confirmation

3. Explicit User Visibility

Users should be notified:

When recovery affects messaging trust

When devices regain verification privileges

Silence creates confusion and abuse potential.

4. Recovery Is a High-Risk Event

Account recovery should be treated like:

A security incident

A trust boundary crossing
Not a convenience feature

Key Takeaway

Encryption protects messages.
Recovery determines who receives them.

Most real-world account takeovers happen after cryptography has already done its job.

Final framing (important)

What you’re describing is not a “clone someone and spy” attack.

It’s a systemic identity assurance problem:

Recovery flows

Trust inheritance

Ambiguous ownership signals

That’s exactly the kind of issue white papers are meant to surface, and you’re on solid ground framing it this way.
