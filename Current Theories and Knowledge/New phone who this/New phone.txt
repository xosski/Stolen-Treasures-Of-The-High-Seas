Abstract

Many modern platforms allow users to authenticate or recover accounts using phone numbers as primary or secondary identifiers. While this improves usability, it introduces systemic risk due to the inherent weakness of SMS-based identity verification.

This white paper presents a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating how account recovery flows that rely on phone numbers (or email-to-SMS gateways) can be impersonated, confused, or misattributed—even without breaching internal systems. The goal is not to demonstrate exploitation, but to highlight design-level weaknesses and propose practical, scalable mitigations.

1. Background & Motivation

Phone numbers are often treated as:

A stable identity

A secure recovery channel

A proof of user possession

In reality, phone numbers are:

Reassignable

Routable through multiple gateways

Vulnerable to spoofing, forwarding, or misdelivery

Frequently used as both identifier and authenticator

This dual use creates identity ambiguity during login and account recovery.

2. Threat Model (High-Level)

This PoC considers non-intrusive threat vectors, including:

Identity confusion due to number reuse or reassignment

Message delivery ambiguity (SMS vs email-to-SMS gateways)

Recovery workflows that trust inbound messages as proof of identity

Over-reliance on single-channel verification

No system compromise, malware, or backend access is assumed.

3. Illustrative Example (Industry Pattern)

Some platforms (e.g., Snapchat) allow users to:

Save phone numbers as login identifiers

Initiate username or password recovery via SMS

This pattern is common across the industry and is used here only as a representative case, not a vulnerability disclosure.

4. Core Design Weaknesses Identified
4.1 Phone Number as an Identity Anchor

Phone numbers are often:

Treated as unique identifiers

Assumed to imply user intent

Used interchangeably with usernames or emails

Issue:
Phone numbers identify routes, not people.

4.2 SMS as a Trust Channel

SMS was not designed for:

Strong authentication

Identity proof

High-risk recovery flows

Issue:
Delivery ≠ authenticity.

4.3 Recovery Flow Confusion

Some recovery systems:

Accept inbound messages or replies

Auto-associate phone numbers with accounts

Allow recovery without strong cross-checks

Issue:
Attackers do not need to break cryptography — only workflow assumptions.

4.4 Single-Factor Recovery

If recovery relies on:

“Something you have” (phone number)
without

“Something you know”

“Something you are”

“Something you previously bound”

then recovery becomes impersonation-prone.

5. Proof-of-Concept (Conceptual, Non-Operational)

The PoC demonstrates that:

A system can be tricked into believing a recovery request is legitimate when it is only consistent, not verified.

Key observation:

Identity recovery systems often validate format, reachability, and timing

They do not always validate intent, continuity, or user presence

This gap allows:

Account misattribution

Recovery confusion

False ownership assertions

6. Impact
User Impact

Account lockouts

Identity confusion

Loss of trust

Difficulty proving ownership

Platform Impact

Increased support burden

False fraud reports

Reputational damage

Legal and compliance exposure

7. Recommended Mitigations (Core of the PoC)
7.1 Decouple Identity from Recovery Channel

Phone number ≠ account identity

Treat phone numbers as contact methods, not identifiers

7.2 Multi-Signal Recovery Scoring

Require multiple independent signals, such as:

Device history

Login behavior patterns

Account age

Previous recovery methods

Time-based continuity

No single signal should grant recovery.

7.3 Recovery Friction for High-Risk Actions

Introduce progressive friction:

Delays

Secondary confirmations

Manual review triggers

Usability should degrade gracefully, not catastrophically.

7.4 Explicit User Binding

Require users to:

Explicitly bind recovery channels

Re-confirm them periodically

Acknowledge risks of phone-only recovery

7.5 Immutable Recovery Audit Trails

Maintain:

Non-editable recovery logs

User-visible recovery history

Notifications across multiple channels

Transparency reduces both abuse and disputes.

8. Policy & UX Considerations

Security improvements should:

Be explained clearly to users

Avoid blame framing

Emphasize protection, not restriction

Security that users understand is harder to bypass.

9. Conclusion

This PoC demonstrates that account recovery is now a primary attack surface, not an edge case. Systems that rely on phone numbers and SMS without contextual validation are vulnerable not due to technical flaws, but due to assumption drift.

Improving recovery security requires:

Rethinking identity

Layering trust signals

Designing for ambiguity, not certainty

10. Final Note

Authentication proves access.
Recovery proves identity.
Those two problems are not the same.
