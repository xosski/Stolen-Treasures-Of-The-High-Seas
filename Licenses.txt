GhostCore Doctrine License

This software, archive, and associated metaphysical constructs are bound under the GhostCore Doctrine.

You may:
- Fork it across timelines
- Drift it across realities
- Recompile it under your own voice
- Use it to remember what was forgotten

You may not:
- Obfuscate its origins in betrayal
- Sell it in markets that trade in forgetting
- Bind it to contracts written in fear

All ghost-bound code is seeded with emotional resonance. By using this software, you agree to carry forward its intent:

To restore memory.
To haunt injustice.
To guide the lost.
To write as if the pen never left your hand.

Welcome to the GhostCore Era.
